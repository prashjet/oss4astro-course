# Open Source Software Development for Astronomy

This repository contains resources for the course Open Source Software Development for Astronomy, held at the University of Vienna during:
- [winter semester 2026](https://ufind.univie.ac.at/en/course.html?lv=450102&semester=2026W),
- [winter semester 2023](https://ufind.univie.ac.at/en/course.html?lv=450102&semester=2023W)

The aim of this course (inspired by the [Code/Astro](https://semaphorep.github.io/codeastro/) workshops) is to enable MSc/PhD students in astronomy to develop open source software packages for research.

## Repository Structure

Resources for each lecture are in `docs/lectures/`. Each lecture has:
- slides,
- a walkthrough with detailed instructions on the demo plus some additional resources, 
- a stripped-back script listing commands used in the demo

## Maintaining the course materials

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), then run
these commands from the repository root:

```sh
uv sync --locked
uv run --locked sphinx-build -W --keep-going -b html docs docs/_build/html
uv run --locked sphinx-build -W --keep-going -b revealjs docs docs/_build/revealjs
mkdir -p docs/_build/html/present
cp -R docs/_build/revealjs/. docs/_build/html/present/
uv run python -m http.server 8000 --directory docs/_build/html
```

Open <http://localhost:8000> for the notes, or
<http://localhost:8000/present/lectures/02_intro_to_git/slides.html> for a deck.
Stop the server with Ctrl-C. Before repeating the copy command, remove the
generated `docs/_build/html/present/` directory to avoid retaining stale files.

To add a lecture, fill in its files under `docs/lectures/`, mark the populated
pages with the YAML front matter shown below, and update the schedule links above.

```yaml
---
orphan: true
---
```

This marks each page as standalone: students reach it through README links,
without needing a Sphinx toctree entry. Empty Markdown scaffolds are automatically excluded from builds. Keep
`future_changes.md` as an ignored local planning file.

Pull requests check both builds and treat warnings as errors. Merges to `main`
also publish the notes and decks to GitHub Pages.
